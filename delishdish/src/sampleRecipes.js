      "name": "Spaghetti Carbonara",
      "description": "A classic Italian pasta dish with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper.",
      "ingredients": [
        "200g spaghetti",
        "100g pancetta",
        "2 large eggs",
        "50g pecorino cheese",
        "50g Parmesan",
        "Freshly ground black pepper",
        "Salt",
        "2 cloves garlic",
        "A small bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley"
      ],
      "instructions": "1. Put a large saucepan of water on to boil. 2. Finely chop the pancetta, having first removed any rind. 3. Finely grate both cheeses and mix them together. 4. Beat the eggs in a medium bowl, season with a little freshly grated black pepper and set everything aside. 5. Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add the spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked). 6. Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it. 7. While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. 8. Drop the garlic into the pan with the pancetta. 9. Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. 10. Take the pan off the heat and set aside. 11. Remove the garlic from the pan. 12. Keep the heat under the pancetta on low when the pasta is ready. 13. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. 14. Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later. 15. Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. 16. Quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. 17. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesnâ€™t scramble, and everything is coated. 18. Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy. 19. Season with a little salt, if needed. 20. Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. 21. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. 22. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived. 23. Scatter with the parsley."
